# ZMK Config for 3x5\_3

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evantravers/zmk-config/master/keymap-drawer/corneish_zen.svg)

- Mainly for my [Corne-ish Zen](https://evantravers.com/articles/2022/04/19/review-corne-ish-zen/).
- Hopefully going to be for a Cygnus soonâ€¦
- I have successfully moved to mostly using a `3x5_2` layout like a Ferris Sweep.
- This layout is more or less mirrored on my [QMK firmware fork](https://github.com/evantravers/qmk_firmware).
